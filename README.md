# Cryptographic Algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a centralized learning resource for basic cryptographic algorithms. Most implementations that can be found online are not specifically designed for learning purposes therefore, they do not offer any or sufficient guidance in order to understand the inner workings of such algorithms. This repository aims to provide not only the implementations but also step by step guidance and explanations in all forms possible (articles, books, videos, courses, tutorials etc.).

# Structure

Each algorithm will have its own folder and its own README.md file. The README.md file will contain an exhaustive tutorial as well as external references meant to allow you to further explore that specific algorithm.

# Contributions

The tutorials provided in this repository (except for the third-party resources) are based on my knowledge and understanding of these algorithms and cryptography in general. If you spot any mistakes of any kind (technical, grammar etc.) in this repository you are welcome to contact me. This will ensure that future learners will be able to enjoy a better and more efficient learning experience.
